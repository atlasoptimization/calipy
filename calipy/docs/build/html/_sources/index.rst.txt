Welcome to calipy's documentation!
==========================================

**calipy** is a Python library for representing, modifying, analyzing, 
and training deep probabilistic instrument models for engineering geodesy.
It employs open pytorch and pyro for probabilistic modelling and an extendable library
of composable probabilistic effects that can be chained to represent geodetic instruments. 
Its API allows flexible interaction between analyst and computational backbone.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <label_installation>` the project.
